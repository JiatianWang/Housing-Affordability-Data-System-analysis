# Housing-Affordability-Data-System-analysis

In this project, I explored various graphing and charting, various measures of central tendency in the data, such as range, interquartile range, standard deviation etc., and measures of covariation between datasets. I also applied hypothesis tests for difference in means and paired two sample means. Finally, I introduced linear regression for predictions, where dummy variables regressions, transforming variables, and interaction effects were covered. All these were introduced and explained in Microsoft Excel. The dataset I used here is “Housing Affordability Data System” of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Research questions/ goals:

* Are there differences in the Market values of occupied versus vacant housing units?
* Is there a pattern in these differences over the period 2005 through 2013? (analyze the differences in Market Rents across various years)
* What factors predict or contribute to housing or the current market value of single-family units?
* Using the regression model to predict future market value for the same properties (use Y variable from 2013, and lag of X variable from 2011)

My analysis falls under five categories
* Summarize basic descriptive statistics for dependent and independent variables 
* Graphical summary before and after Natural Log transformation 
* Hypothesis Test for differences in the variable VALUE
* Regression models
* Prediction results
